# FDC3 Web Implementation

This repository contains a [FDC3 2.0 Conformant](../../fdc3-conformance/README.md), headless implementation of the FDC3 DACP protocol. 

This package forms the basis of the implementation of the FDC3 Desktop Agent reference implementation, found in [the demo module](../demo/README.md) as well as the web-version of [FDC3-Sail](https://github.com/finos/FDC3-Sail/).

It is expected that Desktop Agent implementations can either use this package as the basis for their own FDC3 implementation, use the tests provided here to test their implementation or rake inspiration from the codebase to implement their own FDC3 Desktop Agent from scratch.

## How This Works

There are three main types of component here:

- **MessageHandlers**: These are the core of the FDC3 implementation. They are responsible for handling incoming messages from apps and responding to them correctly.  There are four defined, breaking up the functionality of FDC3:  `BroadcastHandler` (handing channels and broadcasting), `IntentHandler` (handling intents, intent resolution etc.), `OpenHandler` (handling app launches) and `HeartbeatHandler` (handling app liveness and disconnection).

 - **FDC3Server**: This is the main entry point for the FDC3 implementation. It is responsible for setting up the message handlers and starting the server, implemented by `BasicFDC3Server` and `DefaultFDC3Server` classes. 

 - **ServerContext**: This interface is responsible for maintaining the state of the server.  `ServerContext` really determines how FDC3 is run: how messages are sent, how apps are launched, how intents are resolved etc.  It is the main point of customization for an FDC3 implementation. If you are implementing an FDC3 Desktop Agent, you will need to implement this class yourself.   See the [Demo](../demo/README.md), which implements this in-browser as `DemoServerContext`.
