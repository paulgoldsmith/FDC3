    When I call getAgent for a promise result with the following options
      | dontSetWindowFdc3 | timeoutMs | intentResolver | channelSelector |
      | true              |      4000 | false          | false           |
    And I refer to "{result}" as "theAPIPromise"
    Then the promise "{theAPIPromise}" should resolve
    And "{result}" is an error with message "AgentNotFound"

  Scenario: Someone calls getAgent twice
    Given Parent Window desktop "da" listens for postMessage events in "{parentWin}", returns direct message response
    And we wait for a period of "200" ms
    And I call getAgent for a promise result with the following options
      | dontSetWindowFdc3 | timeoutMs | intentResolver | channelSelector |
      | true              |      8000 | false          | false           |
    And I refer to "{result}" as "theAPIPromise1"
    And I call getAgent for a promise result with the following options
      | dontSetWindowFdc3 | timeoutMs | intentResolver | channelSelector |
      | true              |      8000 | false          | false           |
    And I refer to "{result}" as "theAPIPromise2"
    Then the promise "{theAPIPromise1}" should resolve
    And I refer to "{result}" as "desktopAgent1"
    And the promise "{theAPIPromise2}" should resolve
    And I refer to "{result}" as "desktopAgent2"
    And "{desktopAgent1}" is "{desktopAgent2}"
    And I call "{desktopAgent1}" with "disconnect"
