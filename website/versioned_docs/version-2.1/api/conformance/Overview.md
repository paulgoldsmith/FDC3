# FDC3 Conformance Tests

This section contains test definitions that are used to test for conformance of a Desktop Agent API implementation with FDC3.

:::info
As FDC3 2.1 does not introduce changes to the Desktop Agent API, the conformance test set for FDC3 2.0 remains current for this version. Please see the [FDC3 2.1 Changelog entry](https://github.com/finos/FDC3/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#fdc3-standard-21---2023-09-13) for more details.
:::

You can find the implementation of these tests in the [FDC3 Conformance Framework](https://github.com/finos/FDC3-conformance-framework) project.

There are currently 6 sections to the tests.  Where tests apply to a particular version of FDC3, this is labelled with icons in the header, like so: ![1.2](https://img.shields.io/badge/FDC3-1.2-green) ![2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/FDC3-2.0-blue)
