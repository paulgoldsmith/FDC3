# `Country`

A country entity.

Notes:

- It is valid to include extra properties and metadata as part of the country payload, but the minimum requirement
is for at least one standardised identifier to be provided.

- Try to only use country identifiers as intended and specified in the [ISO standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1). E.g. the `ISOALPHA2` property must be a recognized value and not a proprietary two-letter code. If the identifier you want to share is not a standardised and recognized one, rather define a property that makes it clear what value it is. This makes it easier for target applications.
