## Abstract
FDC3 aims to provide an open standard for interoperability on the financial desktop. This includes standardized verbs to invoke actions between applications (called "intents"), a standardized data format, an OpenAPI app directory standard, and standardized API operations.

The specifications are informed by agreed business [use cases](use-cases/overview), and implemented and used by leading [financial industry participants](../../users).

The standard currently consists of four complementary parts:
- **[Desktop Agent API](api/spec)**: An API interface for working with a Desktop agent, which acts as launcher and message router (broker) for applications in its domain. 
- **[Intents](intents/spec)**: A set of verbs that, in conjunction with context data acting as nouns, can be used to put together common cross-application workflows on the financial desktop.
- **[Context Data](context/spec)**: A message format for passing common identifiers and data between apps to create a seamless workflow.
- **[App Directory](app-directory/spec)**: A structured repository of information about apps that can be used in an FDC3-enabled desktop.

## Versioning
This Standard defines FDC3 Version 1.2. The differences between this version and earlier ones can be found in the [Changelog](https://github.com/finos/FDC3/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
