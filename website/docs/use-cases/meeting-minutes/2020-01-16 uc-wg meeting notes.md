## Agenda
### 1. 2020 Move to GitHub - JT (15 min)
- Goal: manage all new UCWG content in GitHub in 2020

**Proposal:** how to manage the UCWG content 
- Meeting Minutes 
  - legacy [keep them on confluence and link to them] AGREED - link to be added
  - new [in github, [this folder](https://github.com/jonathanteperJPMC/FDC3/tree/master/docs/use-cases/meeting-minutes), we also could create a GitHub Issue template] AGREED - link to be updated
- Governance Docs [to be refreshed and moved to the [use cases intro](https://github.com/jonathanteperJPMC/FDC3/blob/master/docs/use-cases-intro.md) page]  - AGREED to move to intro doc, but need to be reviewed and cleaned up. 
  - Ratifying use cases via GitHub PRs - voting done via GitHub (üëç / üëé on an issue - see [UC 17](https://github.com/finos/FDC3/pull/153)) rather than Google Groups - AGREED 
- Use Cases

  - Use Case XX: Template [we can create this as a github issue type] - JT to try and prove this works
- Action Items 
  - to be reviewed and closed out. Relevant ones will be migrated. 
- Process: 
  - One of the participants edits meeting minutes live on a screenshare during the call. All participants on the call review and approve the minutes at the end of the call. Once approved verbally on the call, the meeting minutes PR can be merged.
